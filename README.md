Infrared Sensors works on three fundamental Physics laws:

Planck’s Radiation Law: Any object whose temperature is not equal to absolute Zero (0 Kelvin) emits radiation.
Stephan Boltzmann Law: The total energy emitted at all wavelengths by a black body is related to the absolute temperature.
Wein’s Displacement Law: Objects of different temperature emit spectra that peak at different wavelengths that is inversely proportional to Temperature.
